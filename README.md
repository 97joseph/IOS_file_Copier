# IOS_file_Copier

 A simple file copier and editor

Learning Goal:Â I'm working on a operating systems project and need a sample draft to help me learn.

the program should have the option to copy directories.
I will be using MacOS terminal for this assignment
Hints:

Include fcntl.h

system calls to consider: creat, open, read, write, exit

For directories dirent.h is useful to include, system calls to consider: opendir, readdir

Do not use standard library (i.e. do not include stdlib.h nor use fopen,....etc. This defies the objective of the assignment.

What to turn in:

1. Your source code
2. A shell script to compile your source file and execute it using at least 4 test cases. (attached is an example)
3. Screenshots of the execution of your shell script.
   Note: please put all files in a directory, zip the directory and send it as one file.
